# knot-optimization
A UC Berkeley research project to generate 3D-printed models of topological knots

## Purpose

This project's goal is to automatically generate instructions for assembling 3D-printed elbow-shaped components into physical models of [mathematical knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)).  This task is constrained by the fact that the components may only lock together at certain discrete angles, and that the final knot should be as symmetric as possible.
