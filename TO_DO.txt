- Tune simulated annealing's probability function!
  - Probability slider?
  - Probably want a piecewise probability function rather than a continuous one
    - Conditional cooling?
    - Want a function that becomes closer to 0 towards the end, but takes longer to get there
  - Implement an easier way to choose probability function
  - Statistics for probability functions!
    - How often changes occur in each quarter
    - When best occurs, and whether the process ends on the best possible
    - Distance between theoretical best and best of simulation
    - Distribution of best knots
  - How do we switch between each of the 16 parities?
    - Consider taking 1-moves at random times in the process


- Other potential changes to be made to simulated annealing
  - Manually return to previously best found solution
  - If no steps accepted in 100 moves, automatically ...
  - Develop visualizer.
    - What would this visualizer even do? We don't want to see the knot...
      - real-time data on the statistics that I want to output
        - true acceptance probability of given knot
        - probability that bad move is accepted
        - frequency of change


- Determine the structure of the whatever we're optimizing over!
  - Determine whether
  - Try to find a move that changes parity without being absurd. Otherwise, find a way to overcome the parity problem
    - Allow one step moves?
      - Why would this even help if we don't know which parity would be best?
  - Start thinking about non-trefoil knot!


- Implement cost function for starting parity!

- Ensure that end-cost for simulated annealing is the same cost function as exhaustive!

- Look at what happens when we slightly modify a b-spline.
  - How can we even modify b-splines to begin with?
    - Use parameters for the knot.
      - Tilt
      - Angle (30 to 60 degrees?)
  - Start by running a few b-splines.


- Begin tech report
  - Talk about this in meeting first


- Remember that the number of components need to be at least 12 * number of rotations around the center
  - Implement a heuristic based on that
  - Ensure that bending angles between points on the knot is more or less pi/6 degrees
    - If not, reject
  - Ensure that there is some separation between lines too

- Look for the graph of costs for the moves we have in simulated annealing
- Look to see if we can optimize the curve inputted


Find a way to convert Control Points to a cubic polynomial that spits out points on the b - Spline
- t is spaced equally by number in bspline!
