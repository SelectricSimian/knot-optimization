- Tune simulated annealing's probability function!
  - Probability slider?
  - Probably want a piecewise probability function rather than a continuous one
    - Conditional cooling?
    - Want a function that becomes closer to 0 towards the end, but takes longer to get there
  - Implement an easier way to choose probability function
  - Statistics for probability functions!
    - How often changes occur in each quarter
    - When best occurs, and whether the process ends on the best possible
    - Distance between theoretical best and best of simulation
    - Distribution of best knots
  - How do we switch between each of the 16 parities?
    - Consider taking 1-moves at random times in the process
      

- Other potential changes to be made to simulated annealing
  - Manually return to previously best found solution
  - If no steps accepted in 100 moves, automatically ...
  - Develop visualizer.
    - What would this visualizer even do? We don't want to see the knot...
      - real-time data on the statistics that I want to output
        - true acceptance probability of given knot
        - probability that bad move is accepted
        - frequency of change


- Determine the structure of the whatever we're optimizing over!
  - List of 20 best knots, and their parities (there are 16 of them)
  - List of 10 best knots of each parity, and their distances in terms of number of moves removed from one another
  - Try to find a move that changes parity without being absurd. Otherwise, find a way to overcome the parity problem
    - Allow one step moves?
      - Why would this even help if we don't know which parity would be best?
  - Start thinking about non-trefoil knot!


- Implement cost function for starting parity!


- Begin tech report
  - Talk about this in meeting first
